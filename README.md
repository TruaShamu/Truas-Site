# Trua's-Site
Code for my website on w3spaces.

It's not very responsive, and not very pretty either, but hopefully in the future that will change.

**TODO:**

- Put js and css in right files
- Put components (header/footer/sidebar) in separate files, and use jquery to include them in every page. (DONE)
- Maybe shift the main content slightly to the right so the sidebar can fit nicely.
- Make it more responsive...maybe remove sidebar for devices smaller than a certain size, and also make the navbar expandable as well. Also make margins + padding dissappear for small screens.
