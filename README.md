# Truas-Site
Stuff for my website on w3spaces!
(Built with bootstrap and my poor css skills, of course)

**TODO:**

- Put js and css in right files
- Put components (header/footer/sidebar) in separate files, and use jquery to include them in every page.
- Shift the main content slightly to the right so the sidebar can fit nicely.
- Make it more responsive...maybe remove sidebar for devices smaller than a certain size, and also make the navbar expandable as well.

Anyways, progress on this will probably be a little slow...after all, I still have to do homework and other stuff.

On top of that, I've already used up 900 requests out my 2000 requests/month on w3spaces ;w;
